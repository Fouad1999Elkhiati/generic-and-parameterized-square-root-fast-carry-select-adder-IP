# generic-square-root-carry-select-adder-IP
This is a github repository of a generic nbit square-root-carry-select-adder IP (Intellectual Property) designed in VHDL
# Context :
Introduction: This project is an initial project that falls within a larger project, the aim of which is to delve into the world of digital electronic systems engineering (FPGA) with high efficiency and speed directed at processing digital signals through understanding the working principle of the most important types of primary electronic circuits and previous research in this field, and then working to implement the best designs that It has proven its efficiency in terms of speed, power consumption and space in integrated reconfigurable circuits (FPGA (field programming gate array)) in processing digital signals by implementing well-known mathematical processing algorithms in this academic field, and then there is an attempt to implement improved designs to further improve its performance.

Accordingly, digital signal processing algorithms are based in their entirety on many arithmetic operations, the most important of which are multiplication and addition. Addition operations are the simplest and first. Through this initial introduction, the first project I chose to work on was choosing the most important type of digital Adder that balances between high speed and low power consumption and low surface area in integrated chip.
it is (Carry Select Adder)
Here is a detailed explanation of the working principle of this digital adder and difference between fixed/ variable (square root paradigm) carry select block size in term of worst case propagation delay T(n) with n (number of bits for inputs A and B):

Then I looked into the latest research
